            <h4>Projected COVID-19 Data</h4>

            <p>
              COVIDmapper uses convolution mapping to project COVID-19 case and fatality data. Case frequency functions were derived from those countries (China, South Korea, Singapore, etc.) for which the COVID-19 epidemic had largely completed its course. The resulting curves were then fit to a single consensus time-course function. That function is then convolved (scaled vertically and horizontally) to fit the smoothed past/present data for each jurisdiction (country, state, province, county) tracked by COVIDmapper. The projected COVID case and fatality data are then mapped to each calendar day for that jurisdiction for up to 90 days. The convolution and projection process is updated every day as new data is gathered from each jurisdiction being tracked by the COVIDmapper team. For the most part, these models are reproducing observed COVID data with an error of less than 20%. The COVIDmapper team is developing additional COVID projection models using machine learning, simulations, and other techniques. These will be made available soon. Please remember the following aphorism from George Box (1978) when looking at epidemiological models: <b>“All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</b>
