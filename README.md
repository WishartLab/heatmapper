## COVID-19 updates

In response to COVID-19, Heatmapper has been adapted to
map cold- and flu-like symptoms in Colombia, South America, to enable officials
to better respond to the crisis. People in Colombia can self-report symptoms at
[cov19col.herokuapp.com](https://cov19col.herokuapp.com).
Please help get the word out!

The project is open source, for both the
[self-reporting app](https://github.com/Marco8301/QT-Cov19-OS)
and the heatmapping component (in the `symptom_mapping` branch of this repository).
